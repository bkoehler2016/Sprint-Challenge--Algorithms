#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) runtime O(n)
Given n appears to be doubling resulting in linear compexlity 

b) runtime O(n^2)
It's quadratic  as it's a loop in a loop so we multiple n by n getting n squared. 

c) runtime: O(n) It is recursive, but called based on the number of elements. 

## Exercise II

I would use a binary search, runtime complexity: O(log n).

Start at the middle floor, drop the egg and if it breaks, move down to the next floor and test. If it didn't break we can move up to the next floor. Do this until you have it break on one floor, and stay intact on the one below it
